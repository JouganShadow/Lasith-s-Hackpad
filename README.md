### Inspiration

The main inspiration was that I'm going to pursue Com. science in the future and I was really looking forward to making something like this, the reason I couldnt so far was due to lack of funds, but as soon as I got to know that Hack Club is giving this amazing opportunity I got on my computer and started working on it. The main challenge for this project was that I got to know about it just a day before the due date, but thanks to the inspiring message Mr. Clay the co-founder of hack club blueprint I kept on working on it and finally finished it. This is also my first time using any of these softwares like Kicad and fusion, but thanks to the tutorial I managed to pull through. Thanks a lot to everyone at Hack club!
